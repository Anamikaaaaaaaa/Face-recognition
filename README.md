üöÄ Highlight Project

üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Real-Time Face Recognition System (MATLAB + AlexNet)  
A complete face recognition system that detects, trains, and recognizes faces in real-time using a webcam and deep learning.

**Tech Used:** MATLAB, AlexNet, Deep Learning Toolbox  
**Features:**
- Real-time face detection using webcam input  
- Automated image capture and folder-wise storage (150 images per user)  
- AlexNet-based classification with transfer learning  
- GUI interface via MATLAB App Designer  
- "No Match Found" fallback for unknown faces  
- Tested under multiple lighting and pose variations
